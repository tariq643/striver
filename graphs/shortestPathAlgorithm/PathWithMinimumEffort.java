    A hiker is preparing for an upcoming hike. Given heights,
a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col]
represents the height of the cell (row, col). The hiker is situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0),
and hopes to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1)
(i.e.,0-indexed). He can move up, down, left, or right.
He wishes to find a route that requires the minimum effort.



A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights
between two consecutive cells of the route.


Example 1

Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]

Output: 2

Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute
difference of 2 in consecutive cells. This is better than the
route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
